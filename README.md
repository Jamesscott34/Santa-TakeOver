# Santa TakeOver Application

This Java application creates a fun Santa-themed interface allowing users to enter their names, 
create a list, 
and generate a special message from Santa. 
The application comprises three widgets - the main widget for entering the name,
                                          a list widget to save the user's list,
                                          and a final widget to display a personalized message from Santa.
